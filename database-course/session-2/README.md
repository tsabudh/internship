In this assignment, you will design a database for a Twitter-like application. The database will be used to store user data, tweets, followers, following, likes, comments, hashtags, and trending topics.


The application should have the following features:

Login: Users will need to be able to log in to the application
Tweet: Users will be able to create and post tweets.
Follower: Users will be able to follow other users.
Following: Users will also be able to see which users they are following. 
Like: Users will be able to like tweets. 
Comment: Users will be able to comment on tweets.
Hashtag: Users will be able to include hashtags in their tweets.
Trending: The application will display trending 5 hashtags based on how many times hashtags used in 24 hrs.



Your assignment is to design the database schema using PostgreSQL for this Twitter-like application, including the tables, columns, and relationships. You should also include any additional information such as data types, constraints, and indexes that may be necessary.

Once you have designed the schema, you should create sample queries to test your database design, such as 

Create user
Login user
Create tweet
Follow user
Get a list of a user's followers
Who are following the user 
Like a tweet
Add tag to a tweet
Show trending hashtags
