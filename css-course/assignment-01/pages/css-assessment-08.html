        Assessment 8:
        There is a problem with clear. Find out what it is. Present different methods to solve the problem.

    <p>
        When using floats for layouts, elements are taken out of the document flow. This can cause two primary undesirable behaviors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Elements after the float sneak up in the document

        </li>
        <li>
            Container no longer contains floated elements

        </li>

    </ul>

    <div class="float-container">
        <div class="small-circle"></div>
        <div class="big-circle"></div>
    </div>


    <p><b>This is necessary when you want an element after a floated element to sit below the float.</b> To clear a float, add the clear property to the element that needs to clear the float. This is usually the element after the floated element.
        The clear property can take the values of left, right, and both. Usually you'll want to use both.<br>
    </p>
    <pre>
                <code>
                    .small-circle {
                        clear: both;
                      }
                </code> 
            </pre>

    This approach won't always work however. A more robust method is to use what's known as the "clearfix". This uses the pseudo-element selectors to cause the parent to contain the float.
    <p>
        The clearfix is designed to be used as a class. You can also add this declaration in your stylesheet:
    </p>
    <pre>
                    <code>
                        .clearfix:after {
                            content:"";
                            display:block;
                            clear:both;
                           }
                    </code> 
                 </pre>
