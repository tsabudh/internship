      Assessment 1: Explore other selectors - for states of elements, forms,
      buttons, words, some level 4 selectors.
    </h4>

    <strong> Namespaces in Elemental Selectors</strong>
    <p>
      Type selectors and universal selectors allow an optional namespace
      component: a namespace prefix that has been previously declared may be
      prepended to the element name separated by the namespace separator
      “vertical bar” ie: "|".
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>ns|E</dt>
      <dd>elements with name E in namespace ns</dd>

      <dt>*|E</dt>
      <dd>
        elements with name E in any namespace, including those without a
        namespace
      </dd>

      <dt>|E</dt>
      <dd>elements with name E without a namespace</dd>

      <dt>E</dt>
      <dd>
        if no default namespace has been declared for selectors, this is
        equivalent to *|E. Otherwise it is equivalent to ns|E where ns is the
        default namespace.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <strong>Substring matching attribute selectors</strong>
    <p>
      Three additional attribute selectors are provided for matching substrings
      in the value of an attribute:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>[att^=val]</dt>
      <dd>
        Represents an element with the att attribute whose value begins with the
        prefix "val". If "val" is the empty string then the selector does not
        represent anything.
      </dd>

      <dt>[att$=val]</dt>
      <dd>
        Represents an element with the att attribute whose value ends with the
        suffix "val". If "val" is the empty string then the selector does not
        represent anything.
      </dd>

      <dt>[att*=val]</dt>
      <dd>
        Represents an element with the att attribute whose value contains at
        least one instance of the substring "val". If "val" is the empty string
        then the selector does not represent anything.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <strong>Input Control States</strong>
    <p>
      Three additional attribute selectors are provided for matching substrings
      in the value of an attribute:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>The ":enabled" and ":disabled" Pseudo-classes</dt>
      <dd>
        The ":enabled" pseudo-class represents user interface elements that are
        in an enabled state; such elements must have a corresponding disabled
        state. Conversely, the ":disabled" pseudo-class represents user
        interface elements that are in a disabled state; such elements must have
        a corresponding enabled state.
      </dd>

      <dt>The Default-option Pseudo-class: ":default"</dt>
      <dd>
        The ":default" pseudo-class applies to the one or more UI elements that
        are the default among a set of similar elements. Typically applies to
        context menu items, buttons and select lists/menus.
      </dd>

      <dt>The Automatic Input Pseudo-class: ":autofill"</dt>
      <dd>
        The ":autofill" pseudo-class represents input elements that have been
        automatically filled by the user agent, and have not been subsequently
        altered by the user.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <strong>Selectors Level Four</strong>
    <p>
      Selectors Level 4 describes the selectors that already exist in [SELECT],
      and further introduces new selectors for CSS and other languages that may
      need them. Selectors Levels 1, 2, and 3 are defined as the subsets of
      selector functionality defined in the CSS1, CSS2.1, and Selectors Level 3
      specifications, respectively. The new module defines Selectors Level 4.
      <br />
    </p>
    Some examples:

    <dl>
      <dt>E[foo="bar" s]</dt>
      <dd>an E element whose foo attribute value is identical to bar.</dd>

      <dt>E:any-link</dt>
      <dd>
        Represents an element with the att attribute whose value ends with the
        suffix "val". If "val" is the empty string then the selector does not
        represent anything.an E element being the source anchor of a hyperlink
      </dd>

      <dt>F || E</dt>
      <dd>
        an E element that represents a cell in a grid/table belonging to a
        column represented by an element F.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </body>
