        Assessment 8:
        There is a problem with clear. Find out what it is. Present different methods to solve the problem.

    </h4>

    <p>
        When using floats for layouts, elements are taken out of the document flow. This can cause two primary undesirable behaviors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Elements after the float sneak up in the document

        </li>
        <li>
            Container no longer contains floated elements

        </li>

    </ul>

    <div class="float-container">
        <div class="small-circle"></div>
        <div class="big-circle"></div>
    </div>


    <p><b>This is necessary when you want an element after a floated element to sit below the float.</b> To clear a float, add the clear property to the element that needs to clear the float. This is usually the element after the floated element.
        The clear property can take the values of left, right, and both. Usually you'll want to use both.<br>
    </p>
    <pre>
                <code>
                    .big-circle.float-clear {
                        clear: both;
                      }
                </code> 
            </pre>
    <div class="float-container">
        <div class="small-circle "></div>
        <div class="big-circle float-clear"></div>
    </div>
    This approach won't always work however. A more robust method is to use what's known as the "clearfix". This uses the overflow:auto or pseudo-element selectors to cause the parent to contain the float.
   
   

    <h2>Without "Clearfix" with overflow:auto</h2>

    <p>This image is floated to the right. It is also taller than the element containing it, so it overflows outside of its container:</p>

    <div class="float-container">
        <img class="img1" src="../img/cat.jfif" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
        Look at this handsome cat..
    </div>
    <p>
        The clearfix is designed to be used as a class. You can also add this declaration in your stylesheet:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            .clearfix:: after {
            overflow:auto
            }
            
        </code> 
     </pre>

    <h2 style="clear:right">With overflow:auto</h2>
    <p>We can fix this by adding a <em>clearfix</em> class with <code class="inline">overflow: auto;</code> to the containing element:</p>
    <div class="float-container clearfix-overflow">

        <img class="img2" src="../img/cat.jfif" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
        Why do human beings show such a strong preference for thinking in narratives? From a computational perspective, this method of generating inferences appears to be exorbitantly wasteful. Using students' responses to the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood, I argue that narrative comprehension requires the construction of idiosyncratic imagery, but that the cognitive yield is structural and shared. This peculiar method of information processing, I suggest, is the outcome of evolutionary path-dependence. 

    </div>
    <p>
        The overflow:auto clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and padding <b>(else you might see scrollbars).</b> The new, modern clearfix hack however, is safer to use, and the following code is used for most webpages:
    </p>
    <h2>With Modern Clearfix </h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
            .clearfix:: after {
            content: "";
            display: block;
            clear: both;}
            
        </code> 
     </pre>
     <div class="float-container clearfix">

        <img class="img2" src="../img/cat.jfif" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
       This is random text. The narrative mode of construal is an expert system taking its input from the display of conscious experience, but producing results that are largely unconscious. Drawing on examples from rhesus play, I argue that the core features of narrative thinking have biological roots in strategy formation. Finally, I return to the fairy tale to illustrate the operation of a series of peculiar design features characteristic of human narrative thinking. "Remembering 'Don't put it down, put it away' is the easiest way to keep your home/workspace/room tidy."
